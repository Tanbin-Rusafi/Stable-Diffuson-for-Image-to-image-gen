# Stable-Diffuson-for-Image-to-image-gen
Used pix2pix dataset for finetuning. Resized the dataset according to the demand of google/ddpm-cifar10-32,that I used as unconditional unet inside the pre-trained model "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-3". Configuration is also provided that I used for 40 epocs.
